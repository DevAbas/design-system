// PostToolUse, Edit|Write: the file an agent just wrote gets the core's
// checks at once (`check-files`: the design lint, and for a token source the
// token checks and the staleness check), so a value outside the tokens comes
// back as the next thing the agent reads instead of at commit time.
//
// The edit has already been written: the hook reports it, and the commit gate
// is what enforces. A file changed through the shell gets the same checks
// from check-after-bash.mjs.
