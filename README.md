# Agent-Ready Design System

Set up, audit, fix and gate a web project's design system, so AI coding agents stay on it: W3C Design Tokens (DTCG) as the one source of values, a `DESIGN.md` that holds the rules and no values, and hooks, a pre-commit hook and CI checks that stop an agent the moment it writes a value outside the tokens.

A plugin for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com). Its checks are plain Node scripts with no dependencies, so the pre-commit hook and CI hold the same rules without any agent.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add DevAbas/design-system
```

```bash
claude plugin install design-system@abasturabli
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/design-system:setup` | Plans a token architecture for a new project, waits for approval, then builds it |
| `/design-system:audit` | Checks the project against the Token Architecture rubric and writes a report with stable finding ids |
| `/design-system:fix` | Plans a fix for chosen findings, waits for approval, implements, re-audits and compares |
| `/design-system:harness` | Installs the gates: token and rules checks, Claude Code hooks, a git pre-commit hook and CI |
